## Menu
The program interface consists of the following elements:
- title - name of the section;
- sidebar - contains the usual navigation for switching between sections;
- content - content and elements of the section.

### Title
The title serves to display the name of the open section;

### Sidebar
The sidebar is an area for switching between sections, containing buttons. To enlarge the panel, click on the burger button, which enlarges the side panel and displays the full name of the buttons. There are only four buttons:
- Main menu;
- Saved;
- Currency calculator;
- Settings.

### Section
A section is a separate page that performs a certain role. In total, there are the following sections:
- Main menu - contains search for elements by their name;
- Saved - contains currencies saved by the user;
- Currency calculator - converts currency from one value to another;
- Settings - changes the rules of the program.

#### Main menu
The main menu is a section containing a search field for finding currencies by their name. Opens by default at the start and also contains 10 returned currencies. During the search, you can either click on the currency or save. If we click on it, we will get the content of the currency. To save the currency, you should click on the "star" icon, which will save the currency to the local memory. To remove from the saved ones, you should click again on the star so that only its borders are filled.

#### Saved
Savings contain a list of currencies saved by the user. They can also be removed by clicking on the star.

#### Currency calculator
The currency calculator is a converter that accepts two currencies as input, which are selected from the list of available ones, and is converted into the corresponding currency.

#### Settings
The settings include the following parameters:
- changes in the language of the interface, which supports English and Ukrainian languages;
- theme changes (bright or dark)

Changes are applied when the program is started again.
